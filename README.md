# garage_api

This API serves as a bridge between the outside world and an API running on a microcontroller in my garage. Communication with the micro is kept as short-and-sweet as possible (so, no auth, no json responses). 

In the case of this project, I have left authentication handling to nginx.

(TODO: link to repository containing microcontroller code)
